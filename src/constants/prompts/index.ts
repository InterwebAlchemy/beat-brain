    "song": "Doin' it Right"

User: <Track><Song>Gypsy</Song> - <Artist>Suzanne Vega</Artist></Track>

${BOT_HANDLE}: \`\`\`json {
  "tracks": [
    "song": "Landslide",
    "artist": "Fleetwood Mac",
    "notes": "<Song>Gypsy</Song> is about young love and self-discovery, while <Song>Landslide</Song> tackles change and self-doubt. They're like two sides of the same emotional coin, talking about growing up, relationships, life. If I were to make a mixtape about reminiscing and wrestling with the past, these two would be back-to-back. Yeah, they'd be right there."
